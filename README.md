### Motivation

This application was created as a challenge to build a full stack application using React and Node with a third party API. The client-side should not use the API directly, everything should be handled server-side.

It was also good to have a chance at working with Material UI since there have been developers, and feedback from the community, who mentioned this as an alternative to many other great CSS frameworks.

The application was built with a focus on clean coding, code hygeine and Test Driven Development (TDD).
